Hi, welcome to my page. I am Shuyi. Now I am a team lead at Bloomberg AI group, where I am leading teams working on improving the coding abilities of LLMs with the focus of complex data retrieval problems and deploying the solutions end to end to production. My research interests include Artificial Intelligence for Code, Large Language Models, Generative AI and its engineering solutions and applications in the industry.

Previously, I obtained master degrees of mathematics and computer science from New York University and Georgia Teach. I attended University of California, Los Angeles where I obtained a Bachelor’s in Science (B.Tech) in Mathematics with a specialization in Computer Science and Statistics. During my time in UCLA, I spent two years as a Research Assisstant at the Applied Math departmant work with Professor [Jing Qin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ERCT4PkAAAAJ&hl=en) on using machine Learning algorithms for image processing.
