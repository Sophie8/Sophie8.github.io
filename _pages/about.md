Hi, welcome to my page. I am a engineer team lead at Bloomberg AI group, where I am leading teams working on developing foundational models (LLM, reasoning, coding agent) for coding abilities of complex data retrieval problems in finance.

I was a Senior AI engineer at Bloomberg AI group (2018–2022), focusing on semantic parsing in search and information retrieval. I have worked on several AI services in Bloomberg Terminal mainly for questioning & answering.

I obtained master degrees of mathematics and computer science from New York University and Georgia Teach. I attended University of California, Los Angeles where I obtained a Bachelor’s in Science in Mathematics with a specialization in Computer Science and Statistics. During my time in UCLA, I spent two years as a Research Assisstant at the Applied Math departmant work with Professor [Jing Qin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ERCT4PkAAAAJ&hl=en) on using machine Learning algorithms for image processing for object detection.

My academic and industrial research interest includes semantic parsing, LLM reasoning, tuning strategies for LLM (SFT/RL) and efficient LLM serving.
