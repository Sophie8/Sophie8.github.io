We propose multivariate Platt scaling, which uses SQL sub-clause frequency as a finer-grained signal, to obtain better calibration performance on the popular Spider and Bird benchmarks. The method can be applied post-hoc, without LLM re-training, to present better confidence scores for model outputs or detect errors in generations.
